### Prerequisites

To play Minecraft, you’ll need to have the compatible version of the JRE (Java Runtime Environment).
Usually Minecraft downloads it automatically, but if it doesn’t, you should get it from Adoptium.
The current version used by Minecraft is Java 21.

[Here is the link for downloading Java Runtine Environment 21](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?package=jre&version=21). Please make sure to change the operating system & architecture options according to your machine.
